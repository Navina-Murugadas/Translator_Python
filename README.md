# TRANSLATOR USING PYTHON
  A language translator is a very handy application that helps us to communicate in different languages by translating our language to the desired language. In earlier times, when there were no Language Translation Applications, it was very difficult for people to communicate with people coming from different parts of the world. Today we can create our own language translation project using python.

# Objective:
Our objective is to create a Language Translator which would help us translate a word, sentence or even a paragraph to another language. We will try to incorporate as many languages as possible. We will be using Tkinter Module to build our GUI for the project and googletrans library to present us with a number of languages that are a part of it. 

# Prerequisites:
This project requires a basic understanding of python and the Tkinter module.
To proceed with the project one needs to install the Tkinter Module and Googletrans library using the following commands:
1. pip install tk
2. pip install googletrans

# Steps:
1. Importing the required modules and libraries.
2. Adding and importing the languages to the project.
3. Creating the window.
4. Adding frame, button, text area, and language drop-down to the window.
5. Creating function for translation.
